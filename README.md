# JD-MusicalPasscode
For my Junior Design course independent project

I am making a musical passcode, meaning I have to play specific notes to "unlock" some action.
I am a trumpet player, so I will be unlocking the passcode with my trumpet.

Hopefully, I can make it so ONLY a trumpet can unlock the code, not other instruments.
